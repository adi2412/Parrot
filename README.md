Parrot
======

Parrot is a super easy to use discussion platform that's built to be fast, secure, and simple. It's so quick to install that you'll finally have time to feed Polly that cracker.

Use
===

Currently Parrot is in the development stage. This means that even though you can use it on your server, it's still going to be missing quite a few features. I'd recommend waiting a while. Maybe even check out [this parrot](http://bit.ly/1jnMQ6S) if you have time. If you still want to install, though, just download as ZIP and extract to any directory on your server you want, run the lightning fast installer, and start posting!

Installation
===

The installation procedure has recently changed. You will now need to make a copy of the /system/config.sample.php file (name it config.php) before trying to install Parrot. In here, you will set several values, including database connection details, the base URL being used, and the name of the forum. You will also need to make sure the /system/etc directory is writeable by the webserver.

Why
===

You may be thinking, "Why should I use Parrot when Discourse has a much larger community and has been in development for years?" Well, for starters, Parrot is much more lightweight. Parrot also is super easy to extend, theme, get support for (just visit [the forums](http://codingbean.com/parrot/)), and manage. Besides, it's crafted with love.

Contributing
=========

Parrot will never be done. It'll always be getting improvements, updated documentation, and more users. If you'd like to help create the future of community discussion, just start coding! If you don't know how to code, I'm always looking for designers for theme layouts and custom icons. Head over to the [docs](http://parrot.docci.co/contribute) for a list of needed jobs and instructions.
